## Firmware

I will push the firmware to the official QMK repo, so that you can use QMK configurator. Until then, you can compile the firmware using the raw file in the designated directory with a conventional QMK dev setup. Or, you can use the complied .hex file with QMK toolbox. The comilpled file has a `almost default` Preonic 48 key layout. Please check `keymap.c` file.
